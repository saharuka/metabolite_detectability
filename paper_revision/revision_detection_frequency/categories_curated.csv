The specimen was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, paraffin embedded, and sectioned in the axial plane. We performed MALDI-MSI proteomic analysis on a glottic section containing the polypoid degeneration lesion, and MALDI-MSI glycomic analysis on a section containing the mucus retention cyst.  

Sections were deparaffinized and processed for antigen retrieval. For glycomic analysis, PNGase F was sprayed onto tissue sections using a TM-Sprayer to release glycans. For proteomic analysis, trypsin was sprayed onto tissue sections. DHB was used as the MALDI matrix.

MALDI-MS experiments were conducted using a MALDI-LTQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer equipped with a 60 Hz 337 nm N2 laser. MS data were collected in the positive ion mode with a mass range of 100-3000 mass-to-charge ratio (m/z), mass resolution of 60K, raster step size of 75 µm, and laser energy of 20 µJ.",

Additional_Information,"Sample Description: Ovarian tissues were obtained from age-matched healthy and
cancerous C-strain white leghorn commercial egg laying hens. Birds were managed in accordance with the Institute for Laboratory Animal Research Guide, and all husbandry practices were approved by North Carolina State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). 
Sample Preparation: Tissues were flash frozen in isopentane chilled in a liquid nitrogen bath, and stored at −80 °C until the time of the experiment. The tissues were sectioned into 10 μm-thick sections at −20 °C using a Leica CM1950 cryostat (Buffalo Grove, IL, USA). The tissue sections were thaw mounted onto pre-cleaned glass microscope slides, and were analyzed right away.

Additional_Information,"Sample Description: One healthy male rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) was given
7 daily oral doses of 200 mg of efavirenz (EFV). This dose of EFV equates to roughly 60 mg/kg and is consistent with standard treatment doses for SIV. The animal was euthanized by pentobarbital overdose 24 h after the final dose of EFV, and necropsy was performed by the pathology staff at the California National Primate Research Center.
Sample Preparation: Tissue samples were snap-frozen on dry ice and stored at 80°C until analysis. Ten micron sections of each tissue (dosed
and nondosed) were sliced and thaw mounted on a single glass
microscope slide uniformly coated with internal standards.
